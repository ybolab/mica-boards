# Offline contract tests for hwinit/hwinit-can, which turns /etc/mica/can.conf
# into the systemd-networkd [CAN] configuration of the board's CAN interface.
# The image carries no iproute2: networkd sets the bitrate, restart delay and
# FD mode, and brings the link up, whenever the interface registers.
#
# MICA_CAN_CONF and MICA_CAN_NETWORK_DIR exist for this and are unset on a
# device. networkctl and ip are stubs on PATH: networkctl records its argv, and
# an `ip` call is a failure, so the real script's real command lines are what
# is read back and no host interface is ever touched.

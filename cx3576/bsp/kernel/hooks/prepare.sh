# THE BOOT LOGO, derived here rather than committed. The vendor tree's
# logo_linux_clut224.ppm is REPLACED, which is why this is a file copy and not
# an entry in kernel/patches/: the payload is 2.2 MB of ASCII PPM, and a patch
# carrying it would be a 2.2 MB diff against a file whose every line changes.
#
# rootfs/assets/splash.png is the master (docs/design/display.md section 4).
# Deriving the PPM from it at build time keeps ONE copy of the artwork in the
# tree. mklogo.py is pure integer arithmetic: two runs on one master produce
# one byte string, which a float resampler or a set-ordered quantiser would
# not.
#
# 720x405 IS A CONSTRAINT, NOT A PREFERENCE. fb_prepare_logo drops the logo
# when its height exceeds the mode's yres (fbmem.c:650-653) and
# fb_show_logo_line reduces the copy count to zero when its width will not fit
# xres (fbmem.c:513); both failures are a blank screen, not an error. This
# geometry fits every mode from 800x600 up.

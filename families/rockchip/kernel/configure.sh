#
# The board's committed config is already at .config. In order: the family's
# own edit (LOCALVERSION_AUTO off, so the release string is the tree's and not
# the checkout's), the board's configure hook (its kconfig edits), the shared
# floor merged in, olddefconfig, then the assertions -- the signed-boot floor
# every FIT board holds, the trust anchor, the board's assert hook, and every
# =y line of the shared fragment.
#
# THE OUTPUT IS AN ARTEFACT. The .config this leaves behind is exported by
# kernel/Dockerfile's artifact stage and packaged as /boot/config-<release>,
# and the assembly's verifier reads it back out of the packed root. It is the
# only form of boot/common/mos-required.fragment's floor that survives into an
# assembled image, which is why the assertions below are on the RESOLVED
# config and not on the committed input.
